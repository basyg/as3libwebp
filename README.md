==========

Load WEBP images on Flash using FlashCC or faster ANEs

SWC supported on all platforms including web. It uses FlashCC so it is portable but runs ~3x-5x times slower:
* You must include bin/libwebp.swc

ANE supported for AIR Windows and Android. It uses native libraries so it will run as fast as possible:
* You must include bin/libwebp.ane
